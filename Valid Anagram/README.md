# Valid Anagram

Given two strings s and t, return true if t is an anagram of s, and false otherwise.

### Example 1:

    Input: s = "anagram", t = "nagaram"
    Output: true

    Input: s = "rat", t = "car"
    Output: false

### Note:

You may assume k is always valid, 1 ≤ k ≤ number of unique elements.

Input words contain only lowercase letters.

### Constraints:

- 1 <= s.length, t.length <= 5 * 10^4
- s and t consist of lowercase English letters.

### Follow up: 
What if the inputs contain Unicode characters? How would you adapt your solution to such a case?
