# All pairs with k-diff

You are given an array of integers, considering they are all positives, and a value k. Return all the pairs of array elements which have k-difference

### Example 1:

    Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], k = 5
    Output: [[2,7]]
    Output: Only 2 and 7 have a difference of 5

    Input: nums = [3,2,4], k = 6
    Output: []

    Input: nums = [3,3], k = 0
    Output: [[3,3]]
